Here is my stepson

He and my fiancee live in New York City for the time being.  Being such a long distance, I have to help him with his school studies through Google Hangouts.  We have many sessions in which he e-mails me his issues that he needs help with and we work them out online.  I can remember when we had a lot of sessions in preparation for the NYC Standardized test as I wanted to make sure that he performed his best (and I'm proud to say that he did quite well).  I've always wondered how are the schools performing overall, especially in the Bronx where they reside.  Education is very important to me, especially in the early ages of a child, thus I thought it would be good for me to analyze the NYC test data to see what I can learn.

This repository is my Exploratory Data Analysis on the NYC Test Score Data from 2006-2015.  Here we will analyze the Test Score Data by Borough and School level granularity too see what insights can be found through this data set.  It would be nice to see if some concrete actions could be take in areas and/or schools that may require additional attention.
